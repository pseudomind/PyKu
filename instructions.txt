Currently, the generator is a perl script.

To generate, cd to generator.perl and run 'perl generator.pl'. This will create a folder called generated/perl in the base folder (the svn trunk). In that folder, each kit will have a subfolder.

To compile the bindings for a kit, cd to that kit's folder and run 'perl Makefile.PL', followed by 'make'.

In the base folder there is also a test folder, in which there is a perl subfolder. There is currently a single test file, test.pl, in it. To run this test, cd to this subfolder and run 'perl test.pl'.

That's it for now. It's unfortunately heavily dependant on running things from the folder they're located in; I hope to make it a bit more flexible in the future.
