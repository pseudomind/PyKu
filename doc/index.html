<h3>Bindings Generator</h3>

<p>This bindings generator was created as part of Google Summer of Code 2011. It's purpose was to expose the Haiku API to target languages, but it was designed to be flexible so it could be used to make bindings for other objects as well.</p>

<p>The generator is currently written in Perl; this made development faster. The plan is to eventually port it to C++, but since the focus of the GSoC project was the bindings and not the generator itself, speed in the development process was the most important factor for the generator.</p>

<p>Generating bindings is simple. The usage messsage for the bindings speaks for itself:</p>

<pre>
Usage:

generator.pl -t TARGET -l LANG -f FORMAT FILES
TARGET is the folder you want the generated files to end up
LANG is the language(s) to generated bindings for (one or more)
FORMAT is the definition file format
FILES is a whitespace-separated list if binding definition files

Supported languages are
	perl
	python

Supported formats are
	SIDL - SGML-esque interface definition language
	TIDL - Tab-delimited interface definiton language (coming soon)

Example:
generate.pl -d generated -t perl -t python binding.def
</pre>
